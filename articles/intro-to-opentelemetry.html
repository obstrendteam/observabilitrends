    <h2>What is OpenTelemetry?</h2>
      <p>
        OpenTelemetry is an open-source project that provides a unified set of tools, APIs, and SDKs for generating, collecting, and exporting observability data: <strong>traces, metrics, and logs</strong>. Its goal is to help developers and operations teams instrument and monitor distributed applications, simplifying visibility into the internal behavior of complex systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is OpenTelemetry Important?</h2>
      <p>
        With the rise of microservices architectures, containers, and cloud environments, observability has become a critical pillar to ensure application performance and reliability. OpenTelemetry enables:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardization:</strong> It provides a common format for collecting and exporting observability data, avoiding tool fragmentation.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> It facilitates switching monitoring backends (e.g., from Jaeger to Zipkin or Prometheus) without changing the instrumented code.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> It allows instrumenting applications at scale without significant performance impact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Components of OpenTelemetry</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>APIs:</strong> Interfaces developers use to instrument code, generating traces, metrics, and logs.</li>
        <li><strong>SDKs:</strong> Implementations of the APIs for various programming languages that handle data collection and exporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Collectors:</strong> Services that receive, process, and export data to backend systems for analysis and visualization.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How OpenTelemetry Works</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Code is inserted into the application to capture relevant events, such as API calls, database operations, or errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Generation:</strong> OpenTelemetry creates spans (units of work within a trace), metrics, and logs describing the application's behavior.</li>
        <li><strong>Exporting:</strong> Data is sent to the Collector, which can transform and export it to multiple systems like Prometheus, Jaeger, Grafana, or cloud services.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance Monitoring:</strong> Identify bottlenecks in microservices.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Diagnosis:</strong> Correlate logs and traces to detect failures and understand their context.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Analytics:</strong> Measure user behavior and the effectiveness of new features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advantages Over Other Solutions</h2>
      <p>
        OpenTelemetry unifies previous standards (OpenTracing and OpenCensus), integrating the best of both and fostering an active community with growing ecosystem support.
