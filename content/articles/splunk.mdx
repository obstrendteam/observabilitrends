Splunk excels at log aggregation and search, but to get the most value, mastering **SPL (Search Processing Language)** and dashboards is key.

## SPL Quick Tips

- Use `stats` for aggregation:
```spl
index=web_logs | stats count by status_code
```

- Use `timechart` for trends:
```spl
index=web_logs | timechart avg(response_time)
```

- Filter with `where`:
```spl
| where response_time > 200
```

## Dashboards

Splunk dashboards can use tokens, drilldowns, and real-time searches.

For example, to allow dynamic filtering:
```xml
<input type="dropdown" token="selected_status">
  <label>Status Code</label>
  <choice value="200">200</choice>
  ...
</input>
```

Then use the token in queries.

## Alerts

Set alerts from searches:
- Run SPL regularly
- Trigger if condition met
- Send via email, Slack, etc.

Splunk also integrates with SOAR platforms to auto-remediate certain issues.

For high-scale observability, combining SPL power with visual dashboards is a winning combo.
