title: Deep Dive into Dynatrace Smartscape and Davis AI

Dynatrace provides full-stack observability, but two features stand out for modern ops teams: **Smartscape topology** and **Davis AI**.

## Smartscape

Smartscape is a real-time, auto-generated dependency map. It visualizes:
- Services
- Processes
- Hosts
- Data centers

It updates dynamically and helps pinpoint impact across tiers.

Example use:
> A spike in a frontend error links to a failing JVM on an internal service → visible instantly via Smartscape.

## Davis AI

Davis is Dynatrace’s AI engine. It automatically detects anomalies, but unlike simple thresholding, it uses context-aware causation.

You can ask Davis:
```
Why did our checkout drop in the last 2h?
```

Davis correlates metrics, logs, traces, and problems to offer root cause — often faster than manual inspection.

## Alert Routing & Custom Events

Define custom alerts via Settings > Anomaly Detection. You can:
- Set static or dynamic thresholds
- Link alerts to specific process groups
- Use metadata for routing (team, region, priority)

Dynatrace remains a powerful tool, especially when Smartscape and Davis are used together for contextual, proactive observability.
