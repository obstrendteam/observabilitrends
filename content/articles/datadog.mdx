Datadog is known for integrations — with over 600 out of the box. That makes it easy to build an observability pipeline with minimal config.

## Key Integrations

- Kubernetes (via Agent)
- AWS Lambda
- Docker
- Redis, Postgres
- Jenkins, GitHub Actions

To install:

```bash
DD_API_KEY=<your-key> bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script.sh)"
```

Then configure `/etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml`.

## Dashboards and Monitors

Datadog offers curated dashboards for each integration — but you can clone and extend them.

You can create:
- Composite monitors (e.g., CPU + memory + latency)
- SLOs with burn rate tracking
- Notebooks for incident investigation

## Logging & Tracing

Use the Datadog Agent for log collection and trace forwarding.

```yaml
logs_enabled: true
apm_config:
  enabled: true
```

## Tips

- Tag everything: `env`, `service`, `team`
- Use Live Processes + Network to investigate anomalies
- Send alerts to Opsgenie, Slack, etc.

Datadog simplifies full-stack observability, and its integrations mean faster time to insight.
