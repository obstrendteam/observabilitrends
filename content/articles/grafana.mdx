Grafana is widely used for building observability dashboards. But not every user extracts its full potential — especially for business-centric use cases.

## Key Plugins and Customizations

One notable plugin is **Business Charts for Grafana**, which enables users to create pie charts, bar charts, and financial views that were traditionally harder in Grafana’s default UI.

To install:

```bash
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-business-charts-panel
```

After restart, select "Business Charts" from the visualization list.

## Panel Tips

- Group data using `group by` with meaningful business tags (like `region`, `department`)
- Set thresholds and use overrides to visually flag issues
- Use repeat panels to dynamically display by service or location

## Alerting Essentials

Grafana’s alerting can now run independently from panels. You can define rules in the **Alerting > Rules** section and manage them through Grafana’s new Unified Alerting system.

For example:

```yaml
- alert: HighCPU
  expr: avg(rate(cpu_usage[1m])) > 80
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
```

## Best Practices

- Organize dashboards into folders by function or team
- Use template variables to improve reuse
- Avoid overplotting — hide series or group where needed

Grafana remains a top-tier choice, especially when customized with plugins and structured thoughtfully for business insights.
