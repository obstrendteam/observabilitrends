title: Prometheus Metrics and Alerting Best Practices

Prometheus is the cornerstone of many observability stacks. Its flexibility and power lie in **custom metrics** and **PromQL**.

## Instrumentation Tips

- Use clearly defined metric names: `http_request_duration_seconds`
- Label strategically: avoid high cardinality labels like `user_id`
- Track duration, errors, throughput (RED method)

## PromQL Essentials

PromQL allows aggregations, filtering, and alert expressions.

```promql
rate(http_requests_total{job="web"}[5m])
```

This expression shows request rate over 5 minutes.

Other useful examples:

```promql
avg_over_time(memory_usage_bytes[10m])
sum(rate(errors_total[1m])) by (service)
```

## Alerting

Prometheus uses **alerting rules** to detect conditions.

```yaml
- alert: HighMemory
  expr: node_memory_Active_bytes > 1e+09
  for: 5m
  labels:
    severity: warning
```

These rules are pushed to Alertmanager, which handles deduplication, routing, and silencing.

Prometheus thrives when paired with:
- Grafana for visualization
- Loki for logs
- Tempo for traces

Itâ€™s lean, fast, and highly customizable.
